# signChecker

Since I've had an issue on the Xcode 11.4 or later, I decided to make a sample app in order to reproduce the bug and figure out how can I deal with it! 

How to reproduce the bug:
 1) Install Xcode 11.4 or later 
 2) Clone the project.
 3) Run the project on the release mode.
 4) Input a string and sign it.
 5) Tappe the verify button, you should see the bug
